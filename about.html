        <h1>About The River Nile</h1>

    </div>

    <p>
        The river nile is in africa. It flows through lots of different countries. The countries it flows through is
        Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Burundi and Egypt. The mouth of the nile is the Mediterranean Sea and its source is a
        lake in Burundi called Lake Victoria. The river nile was very important to the Ancient Egyptians because it
        could not exist without the nile. In Egypt there is not much water so the nile was one of their only ways they
        could recieve water. The rivers floods also helped growing crops, as well as that they used it to get fish and
        other foods.
